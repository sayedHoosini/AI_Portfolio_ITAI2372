## 🔍 Why Healthcare Needs AI

- Rising global health costs (expected to reach $18T by 2040)  
- Medical errors and delayed diagnoses  
- Shortages of healthcare professionals  
- Need for faster, more accurate results  

---

## 🧬 AI Techniques in Use

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** – Analyze X-rays, MRIs, and other images  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – Processes clinical notes and EHRs  
- **Machine Learning** – Builds predictive models for disease detection  
- **Reinforcement Learning** – Powers robotic surgeries  
- **Generative AI** – Assists in algorithm synthesis for drug/vaccine development
