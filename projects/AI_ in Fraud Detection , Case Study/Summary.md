## 💡 Key Problems with the Old System

- Rule-based system generated over 1,200 false alerts daily  
- Failed to catch ~60% of actual fraudulent transactions  
- Slow manual review processes caused inefficiencies and delays  

---

## 🤖 AI Solutions Implemented

- **Deep Learning Models** trained on customer transaction data  
- **Real-Time Detection** using GPUs to speed up processing  
- **Champion/Challenger Model Setup** to continually test and improve detection accuracy  
- Adaptive AI that learns individual customer behavior and flags abnormal activity

## 📈 Outcomes and Benefits

- 60% reduction in false positives (targeting 80%)  
- 50% improvement in fraud detection accuracy  
- Time and cost savings from fewer manual reviews  
- Enhanced customer experience due to fewer transaction blocks  
- Streamlined investigations using detailed transaction patterns  

---

## ⚙️ Challenges Faced

- Infrastructure upgrades and cloud integration needed  
- Data fragmentation and quality issues slowed model training  
- Human review still required for edge cases  
- Continuous model retraining needed to counter evolving fraud tactics  
- Cross-functional collaboration (fraud analysts + data engineers + compliance teams) was key  

---

## 🔍 Conclusion

Danske Bank’s case demonstrates how AI can outperform traditional systems in fraud detection. With the right strategy, tools, and team, banks can use AI to reduce financial crime, save costs, and enhance trust. This case reinforces the importance of high-quality data, flexible AI models, and human oversight in any AI-powered financial solution.
