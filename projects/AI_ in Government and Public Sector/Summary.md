## 🌍 Project Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in government refers to the use of advanced technologies to enhance public service delivery, improve decision-making, and streamline operations. From law enforcement and transportation to healthcare and taxation, AI is modernizing governance and transforming civic engagement in the digital era.

## 🧠 Key AI Techniques in Government

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Powers government chatbots (e.g., "Ask Jamie" in Singapore), automates document scanning, and supports citizen service portals.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Helps detect fraud, forecast public health trends, and optimize urban traffic and infrastructure planning.
- **Computer Vision**: Monitors roads, bridges, and natural environments for structural damage or environmental hazards.
- **Robotic Process Automation (RPA)**: Used by the U.S. IRS to process tax returns and reduce form backlogs.
