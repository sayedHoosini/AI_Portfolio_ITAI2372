## 🧠 AI Techniques in Use

- **Machine Learning (ML)** – Predicts traffic demand and flow  
- **Computer Vision** – Detects traffic violations and pedestrian activity  
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** – Optimizes traffic light behavior  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – Supports voice assistants and transit bots  
- **Data Fusion** – Integrates data from GPS, cameras, and sensors  
- **Edge AI** – Enables local processing for faster and private decisions
